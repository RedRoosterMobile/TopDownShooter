Lights:
When two pixels with alpha 0.5 overlap, the resulting alpha would not be 1.0, but it would be closer to 0.75. This is because alpha blending is not simply additive. The formula for alpha blending is:

Resulting Alpha = Alpha1 + Alpha2 * (1 - Alpha1)

A* pathfinding

random level generation??
fog of war ? https://youtu.be/jHt_5y671BQ?si=E_idr47dCzrGzgIY&t=239


make them jump at you
you have to push a button (minigame) to get enough force to:
push away the zombie (slow mo)
to then be able and shoot him and potentially others
during bullet time

works better when against the wall


when shot, make them fly off in the opposite direction
leaving a trail of blood on the floor
they will keep bouncing off walls(or explode?)

Strafing:
look up, shoot up by holding space
keep holding space, to strafe anywhere while pointing up and shooting up
until space is let go, then back to normal

Permanence:
- bullets,
- footprints
- blood splatters (from particle system?)


alternative fog of war:
https://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src/game%20objects\render%20texture\render%20texture%20as%20a%20mask.js

paint all light to a render texture, use that as mask (have transparency gradients and stuff)
keep painting current FOV to texture, add more stuff, like lights in the map

tiled:

embed tilesheet
export csv


Permanence:
paint all the stuff to a render texture
texture will be just above floor
enemies+bullets need to be painted there after deleting the body and then delete the original sprite
